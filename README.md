# Sitecore.ContentCheckIn
The purpose of this module is to allow a role-based approach to allowing non admin users the ability to see and use the Check In / Unlock feature of workflow. This is useful if there are super users in Sitecore that need to be able to unlock items other authors have locked, for example before they went on vacation.
